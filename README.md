# ausLCI-processes-unlinked
This is a collection of all the ausLCI processes/databases, unlinked, downloaded from their websites. Intended for use if you want to upload them to openLCA or whatever software of your choice and link them manually, or for just general independent usage. I believe there might be a couple of corrupted sheets in there, apologies!
